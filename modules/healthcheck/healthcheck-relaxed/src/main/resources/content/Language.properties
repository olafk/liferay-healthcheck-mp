healthcheck-relaxed-configuration-description=Some systems - e.g. development and demo systems - benefit from a rather relaxed set of configuration items. This section allows you to specify the systems that you'd like to validate with relaxed settings, that explicitly trade comfort for security. Recommendation: Keep disabled on PRD systems.
healthcheck-relaxed-configuration-name=Relaxed Settings
healthcheck-relaxed-instance-hostnames-description=Configure the instance's virtual host names on which you want to apply relaxed healthchecks. This is matched with the value in "Instance Settings / Instance Configuration / General / Virtual Host". A separate healthcheck will make sure that this is the actual system that is accessed, so that you can run relaxed settings only in specific environments. If you want to run in all environments, enter ALL, if you never want to run relaxed settings, set to NONE (default). All other values are interpreted as host name. There is no pattern matching, you need to be explicit
healthcheck-relaxed-instance-hostnames-name=Instance Virtual Host Name
