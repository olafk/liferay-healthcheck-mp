healthcheck-category-relaxed=Relaxed 
relaxed-healthcheck-setting-strangers-need-to-be-validated-by-mail=With relaxed settings it's assumed that users' accounts changes don't need to be validated with an extra mail (configure the hostnames for relaxed settings in System- or Instance-Settings)
relaxed-healthcheck-setting-password-policy-change-required=With relaxed settings it's assumed that the password policy does not require a user's password to be reset when it has been set by an administrator (configure the hostnames for relaxed settings in System- or Instance-Settings)
relaxed-healthcheck-setting-fragment-propagation=With relaxed settings it's assumed that fragment changes are automatically propagated to all uses of a fragment (configure the hostnames for relaxed settings in System- or Instance-Settings)
relaxed-healthcheck-setting-session-extension-enabled=With relaxed settings it's assumed that the session is extended as long as a browser is open (configure the hostnames for relaxed settings in System- or Instance-Settings)
healthcheck-relaxed-configuration-description=Some systems - e.g. development and demo systems - benefit from a rather relaxed set of configuration items. This section allows you to specify the systems that you'd like to validate with relaxed settings, that explicitly trade comfort for security. Recommendation: Keep disabled on PRD systems.
healthcheck-relaxed-configuration-name=Relaxed Settings
healthcheck-relaxed-instance-hostnames-description=Configure the instance's virtual host names on which you want to apply relaxed healthchecks. This is matched with the value in "Instance Settings / Instance Configuration / General / Virtual Host". A separate healthcheck will make sure that this is the actual system that is accessed, so that you can run relaxed settings only in specific environments. If you want to run in all environments, enter "ALL", if you never want to run relaxed settings, set to "NONE". All other values are interpreted as host name. There is no pattern matching, you need to be explicit (Default is "localhost", assuming that it's a local development system and comfort is more important than secure configuration)
