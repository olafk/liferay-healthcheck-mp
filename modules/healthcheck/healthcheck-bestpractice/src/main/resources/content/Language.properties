configured-locale-x-from-section-x-has-less-than-5-characters-length=Detected locale {0} in section {1} should have at least 5 characters in language code

configured-locales-are-provided-by-jvm=All configured locales are provided by the JVM
default-account-testliferaycom-should-not-exist-with-default-pwd=The default user account test@liferay.com should be deleted and/or the password changed from the default ("test")
default-hashing-bcrypt-should-use-workfactor-x-detected-x=Default hashing algorithm bcrypt should use a workFactor of 10 or more (OWASP 2025). Detected {0}
default-hashing-pbkdf2withhmacsha1-should-use-workfactor-x-detected-x=Default hashing algorithm pbkdf2-with-hmac-sha1 should use a workFactor of {0} or more (OWASP 2025). Detected {1}
do-not-trust-self-signed-dataprovider-certificates=In a production system, you should never blindly trust self-signed certificates (checked for DataProviders). This opens you to a MITM attack.
found-well-known-siteinitializer-user-account-x=Some Site Initializers contain hard coded accounts. Those should not be present in production systems - even deactivated. Found {0}
healthcheck-bestpractice-configuration-description=Configure some values here that you consider Best Practice for your installation, so that Healthchecks won't complain about these settings.
healthcheck-bestpractice-configuration-name=Best Practice
healthcheck-bestpractice-max-users-tested-for-hashing-algorithm-whitelist-description=Healthchecks will test a sample amount of user accounts for the currently used hashing algorithms. With large user-databases this might take considerably long, so you can/should configure the sample-size here in order to ensure quick execution time.
healthcheck-bestpractice-max-users-tested-for-hashing-algorithm-whitelist-name=Number of users tested for their current password hashing algorithm
healthcheck-bestpractice-password-hashing-algorithm-whitelist-description=If you have a history of using different password hashing algorithms, not all user accounts might already use the currently configured preferred algorithm. List the algorithms here that you consider to be unproblematic to be used in your instance
healthcheck-bestpractice-password-hashing-algorithm-whitelist-name=Whitelisted Password Hashing Algorithms
insecure-hashing-algorithm-x=insecure hashing algorithm {0}
no-default-siteinitializer-user-found=No default user account, created by site initializers, was found.
unknown-hashing-algorithm-x=unknown hashing algorithm {0} (or not implemented in healthcheck)
x-out-of-x-users-dont-use-hashing-algorithm-x-but-x={0} out of tested {1} users do not use a whitelisted or default password hashing algorithm {2}, but {3}
x-out-of-x-users-use-default-hashing-algorithm-x={0} out of tested {1} users use the configured default password hashing algorithm {2}
